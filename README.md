# Happy Dogs Home

# About

This is my first Milestone Project for my Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Institute. I will be using HTML and CSS only.

For this project I am creating a simple website for a fictional new shelter for dogs. The website is simply structured with only the most important information on show, however there is scope for future expansion.

The basic aim of the website is to introduce people to the charity and encourage visitors to adopt a dog.

## Strategy

I am looking to attract as wide a range of visitors as possible. Most will be people who like dogs and may have an interest in making an adoption.

### User Stories

I am a first time visitor and I want:

* To find out what this website is for
* To know where the charity is located
* The site to be easy to 'learn', navigate and use 
* To see lots of pictures of happy dogs
* To be able to easily contact the charity in order to make an adoption or make an enquiry
* To follow the charity on social media
* To use the site on mobile/tablet/desktop

I am a returning visitor and I want:

* To see what dogs are available
* To see any updates (in operational procedure/covid changes etc)

I am the website owner and I want:

* Visitors to have a positive first impression
* Visitors to want to make a donation
* People to want to make an adoption
* To receive feedback on the new site
* For visitors to subscribe to blog or mailing list to keep them engaged

### Strategy Trade-off table 

Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
--------------------|------------|-----------
Create an online presence | 5 | 5
Show off our dogs | 5 | 5
Provide means to donate online | 4 | 1
Increase social media following | 4 | 4
Blog/updates/mailing list | 3 | 2
Encourage visitors to adopt | 5 | 5

# Scope 

The primary objective of this site is to create and develop an online presence for the new charity. This means that it is initially created as a Minimum Viable Product. This allows us to begin with the most important aspects and expand from there. We can also test what works and what doesn't. Therefore it is also sensible to provide the opportunity for visitors to give feedback so we can improve existing features and find out what new features are needed.

The strategy trade-off table above helps us work out what we can and can't implement at this stage. It also tells us what the most important features are. These are as follows:

1. Create online presence and introduce ourselves to visitors
2. Show off our dogs
3. Encourage people to adopt
4. For visitors to be able to easily contact us for anything and provide feedback

Allowing people to donate online and adding operational updates/blog is outside my current skillset, however these are important features which can be looked at in future.

With this in mind I have separated current features in order of importance and listed off future features that could potentially be added at a later stage.

Starting features:

* Introduction to the charity
* Photos and descriptions of our dogs
* 'Why Adopt' section encouraging people to adopt
* Contact Us form and address/contact information. Social media links.

Future Features:

* Payment/Donation/Sponsorship options
* Blog
* General operational updates
* Mailing list

# Structure 

The website initially functions as a single scrolling page in a linear structure. This is the most simple and accessible way of navigation and information display. This is ideal for this site as we are looking to attract as wide a demographic of visitors as possible. We want visitors to be engaged immediately and for them not to be overwhelmed. There are nav links on the top of the screen, which take the user to different sections of the page. This will be fixed to the top of the screen when scrolling to enable the user to access them at any time.

The top navigation links will change colour when that section is active and upon hovering to provide the user with simple visual feedback on where they are and how to get to where they want to go within the site. There are also clear dividers and headings for each section.

The submit button in the contact section also changes colour when hovering and provides feedback to the user once the form has been submitted. If there is any issue with what has been submitted i.e. a required field has not been filled in then this information will be clear.

On tablet and mobile devides the nav link is compressed to the hamburger style menu as standard on smaller devices. It also includes social media links so these have maximum visiblity.

Each page section has a clear function and purpose.

### 1. Header - Logo, title & Navbar

* The logo and title are on the left with the navbar on the right. The navbar is compressed to hamburger icon when using on tablet or mobile. This helps the visitor find their way around the website as well as providing useful links to our social media pages.

### 2. Home - Hero Image 

* Large hero image of happy dogs playing with large text 'Give them a happy home'. There is a box laid over the image which takes the user directly to the contact pages with the text 'I want to adopt a dog'. The positive text and imagery instantly elicits a positive response from a visitor and makes the sites function clear.

### 3. About Us

* General information to the shelter - when/why/how we started and what our objectives are. This section is friendly and inviting to the reader. This provides the visitor with facts on who we are and what we do - reinforcing our legitimacy and providing human context.

### 4. Meet the dogs!

* Pictures and information about our dogs. Initially this displays 3 dogs. On mobile the visitor initially sees only the photo but when clicking the picture a modal box is opened with the info included. There is scope for expansion on this section - this can link to a further page with all of our dogs included but for now is just a showcase.

### 5. Why Adopt?

* This works as a brief info/advertising section to encourage people to adopt. There will also be photos of dogs to break the page up which keeps it visually appealing and triggers further positive emotions from the user.

### 6. Get in touch

* Contact form for all enquiries. This has standard inputs for name/email/telephone. There is a checkbox list for the user to specify the purpose of their enquiry as well as a large text field to add further questions/detail. There is also a text box informing the customer that we aim to respond to all enquiries within 24 hours of receipt. Name/email/telephone/enquiry type fields are all required with the larger text box optional. This has a broad scope for the visitor who can make any enquiry needed from once place.

### 7. Footer - Contact info and social

* As is standard, we include our phone number, email address and place address on the bottom of the page. This is located immediately below the contact section so these two sections can be seen as one larger one. Opening hours also included as well as the social media links again.

This is a mobile first design using bootstrap to adjust column number and positioning. On mobile each column will fill the screen horizontally while on larger devices we can fit more features into each horizontal space.

# Surface

I am using a simple colour palette generated on [Coolers.co](www.coolers.co) which will ensure visual clarity. I have opted for a green theme as this represents nature and the outdoors which suits dogs well. [Green is also the second favourite colour for both men and women as well as the easiest for the eye to process.](https://images.websitebuilderexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/23005313/color-psychology.jpg)

My chosen font is Yusei Magic for the headings and Lato for the paragraphs. These are both taken from the google fonts collection. Yusei Magic has a handwritten feel and gives the viewer a friendly and homely impression. Lato pairs well with Yusei Magic, is easy to read and is a commonly used font online for larger of text for this reason.
