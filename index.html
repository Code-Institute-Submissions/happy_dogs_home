                        <p>Benji is a stunning looking boy, he does have a bit of a sensitive side and it took him a
                            couple
                            of days to come around but once bonded he is an affectionate dog with a peaceful soul.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            He did have some issues in his previous home and was a bit protective of his owner so Benji
                            will need ongoing work to teach him to share and cannot have children in the home.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            He does have some good manners in place and have nice social skills around other dogs and
                            could
                            live with a female dog.

                        <p>Ricky is a gentle and affectionate dog who enjoys snuggling up to people for a fuss.
                            He is happiest when he has company so has found being in the kennel environment a bit
                            stressful.
                            <br>

                            Ricky is looking for a home with owners who will be home most of the day and are happy to
                            put in
                            the time and dedication in teaching him how to relax when he is left alone.

                            Ricky has shown some nice social skills with dogs and could possibly live with a sociable
                            steady
                            dog that could act as a good role model but also be happy to engage in some calm play

                        <p>Terri is an affectionate lady with a worried side who is looking for new owners with
                            experience
                            of owning anxious dogs themselves before.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A nervous lady, Terri has struggled with being handled at times, and will need a calm,
                            confident
                            approach to not put too much pressure on her while she settles. Due to her worried side, she
                            will need to live in an adult only home away from children, and is not necessarily a family
                            dog
                            that will enjoy a cuddle. Molly does enjoy being with her people once she has bonded, but
                            she
                            will need time to work on this in her new home. She is happy to explore on her walks, but
                            can be
                            anxious of fast movement, and noise, and so will need quiet walks - she is equally happy to
                            have
                            a snooze on her bed at home!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            She would be best suited as the only dog in the home. She should be socialised regularly
                            with
                            steady walking buddies who can guide her in the right direction and help to build her
                            confidence, as she does not have much experience with them.

                            overflowing with dogs and cats, they sometimes have to turn away animals simply because they
                            do
                            not have enough room. So when you adopt your dog, another one can take its place.</p>
