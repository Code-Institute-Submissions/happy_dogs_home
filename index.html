                    <p>Benji is a stunning looking boy, he does have a bit of a sensitive side and it took him a couple
                        of days to come around but once bonded he is an affectionate dog with a peaceful soul.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He did have some issues in his previous home and was a bit protective of his owner so Benji
                        will need ongoing work to teach him to share and cannot have children in the home.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He does have some good manners in place and have nice social skills around other dogs and could
                        live with a female dog.

                    <p>Ricky is a gentle and affectionate dog who enjoys snuggling up to people for a fuss.
                        He is happiest when he has company so has found being in the kennel environment a bit stressful.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ricky is looking for a home with owners who will be home most of the day and are happy to put in
                        the time and dedication in teaching him how to relax when he is left alone.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ricky has shown some nice social skills with dogs and could possibly live with a sociable steady
                        dog that could act as a good role model but also be happy to engage in some calm play sessions.

                    <img src="assets/images/Terri.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block circular-image" alt="Terri the dog">
                    <p>Terri is an affectionate lady with a worried side who is looking for new owners with experience
                        of owning anxious dogs themselves before.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A nervous lady, Terri has struggled with being handled at times, and will need a calm, confident
                        approach to not put too much pressure on her while she settles. Due to her worried side, she
                        will need to live in an adult only home away from children, and is not necessarily a family dog
                        that will enjoy a cuddle. Molly does enjoy being with her people once she has bonded, but she
                        will need time to work on this in her new home. She is happy to explore on her walks, but can be
                        anxious of fast movement, and noise, and so will need quiet walks - she is equally happy to have
                        a snooze on her bed at home!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        She would be best suited as the only dog in the home. She should be socialised regularly with
                        steady walking buddies who can guide her in the right direction and help to build her
                        confidence, as she does not have much experience with them.

                    <h2>Because You'll save a life</h2>
                    <p>The number one reason to adopt a dog is that you will be saving their life. Many shelters are
                        overflowing with dogs and cats, they sometimes have to turn away animals simply because they do
                        not have enough room. So when you adopt your dog, another one can take its place.</p>
                    <h2>Adopting will change your life too</h2>
                    <p>Dogs have a way of stealing our hearts with one look of those big brown eyes! Dogs have a way of
                        keeping us healthy and active. If you have had a bad day, a dog can make you smile and they have
                        been proven to reduce stress in humans.</p>
